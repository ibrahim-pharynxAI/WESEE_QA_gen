Accordingly; when an officer performs journey by road on official duty by private car and claims Mileage Allowance, a certificate to the effect that the journey has been undertaken by private car in the interest of public service, should be attached to the TA claim. In the case of an officer on an official journey on tour in his private car between places connected by rail, rail being the ordinary mode of travel, the road mileage will be limited to rail fare between the two places. The HOM may relax the limit if the road journey is performed in the public interest.  Thus an

officer travelling on duty in his own car can get Road Mileage Allowance at the prescribed rate if the HOM certifies that the journey by private car is in the public interest and also records in writing the nature of the public interest served by the officer's travelling by private car instead of in a public transport.

An illustrative and not exhaustive list of the cases where a journey on duty undertaken in an officer's private car be considered in the interest of public service is given below: The discretion vested with the HOM can be exercised by him in all cases in which he considers , after taking into account circumstances and merits of each case, that the journey by an officer in his private car is in the interest of public service. In such cases, he shall, however; have to satisfy audit, if audit considers that the concession has been abused;

- (1) A journey undertaken for reasons of secrecy or security:
- (2) A journey undertaken by an officer in custody of confidential and secret documents.
- (3) A journey undertaken at short notice when it was not possible for an officer to be at a specified place at a specified time if he travels by the approved means and route of travel.

6. (ii) In addition to the Road Mileage Allowance; officers will be reimbursed the actual charges for tolllferrylparking and also the actual charges for garaging subject to a laid down ceiling per night which should be supported by either a certificate or vouchers wherever available.
7. In the case of journeys performed by taxi; bus or lorry plying for hire, the actual fare(s) paid will be reimbursed to the officer. Since the cost of a full taxi is considerably higher than that of taking a seat in a bus or hiring

plying for hire, the use of full taxi should be kept to the absolute minimum. Only in cases where it is not possible to perform a specified journey by other means of public transport either because the competent authority considers that the journey should be performed in a taxi in public interest; a full taxi may be engaged. As a general rule, individuals drawing Grade below ? 5,400/- should not be allowed the use of full taxi. lorry Pay

They are accordingly expected to make a reasonable use of their cars for proper discharge of their official duties irrespective of the fact whether it is purchased out of an advance from Government or private sources. This is because of the consideration that certain concessions are extended to them, e.9. transportation charges of car at the time of transfer, compensation for additional car insurance while serving abroad, reimbursement of customs duty when cars are imported to India. In view of these; the claims for mileage allowance or taxi charges may be regulated as follows:

If, however; the car is not in working condition or local conditions in the view of the HOMs do not permit the use of the officer's own car, the staff car can be used. If a staff car is also not available, a taxi may be hired in this respect. A taxi may be hired in cases where public transport cannot be used in public interest and actual charges incurred by the officer reimbursed under the powers delegated to the Government of India's representatives abroad subject to the conditions prescribed in this respect.

If, however; the officer does not use his personal car at the outstation of his own volition, he will not be entitled to reimbursement of taxi charges if incurred by him. However; if the car goes out of working order at the outstation; taxi charges actually incurred on trips on duty may be reimbursed subject to the HOM satisfying himself about the reasonableness of his claim. Taxi charges are reimbursable only when an officer's car is not in working condition and that too when it is actually incurred.
