## SCENARIO 2: FULL MARITIME QUARANTINE

This scenario is a significantly scaled-up version of the first scenario. Like the first scenario, China declares new

'enhanced customs inspection rules' that will require advance notice with Chinese authorities to ship goods into Taiwan.

This time, however, China publicly announces a quarantine area covering the entire island of Taiwan. The zone extends 24 nautical miles from Taiwan's territorial baseline, matching with Taiwan's claimed contiguous zone. This is intended to delegitimize the contiguous zone and demonstrate China's willingness and capability to impose its will in an area ostensibly under Taipei's jurisdiction.

Chinese authorities announce that the inspection regime will go into effect 48 hours after declaration. China will require the shipper of any cargo destined for Taiwan to  file  advance notice with Chinese customs and law enforcement officials.

China again deploys law enforcement vessels to lead the quarantine, but this time it sends a much larger overall contingent. The greatest concentration, consisting of more than 10 coast guard and maritime safety vessels, is positioned off the coast of Kaohsiung. It also deploys a dozen vessels off the west coast ports of Taipei and Taichung and sends nine near the northern Port of Keelung-Taiwan's second-busiest import hub. Finally, it sends another six to the smaller eastern ports of Hualien and Su'ao.

This deployment of more than three dozen law enforcement vessels amounts to an unprecedentedly large maritime operation for China. It would constitute approximately one-fourth of China's oceangoing CCG and MSA fleet.

Roughly 40 maritime militia vessels also swarm Taiwan's coastal waters, along the contiguous zone, to fill in gaps between law enforcement vessels. As in the limited quarantine scenario, the maritime militia vessels do not
