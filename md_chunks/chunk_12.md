## CONCLUSION

For both these maritime scenarios, Beijing's goal is not to hermetically seal off Taiwan. Instead, these campaigns are designed to punish Taiwan, assert Beijing's claimed sovereignty over the island, test the response from international shipping companies, and put significant pressure on Taiwan.

While China has the capabilities to successfully execute these and other quarantine variations, these would require operations that are far more complex than anything China has demonstrated to date. Such moves would carry significant risk for China, and its success would depend to a large degree on how Taiwan, the United States, and others respond.

Even if successfully implemented, there are limits to what a quarantine can achieve. If Beijing's goal is to inflict enough pain to force Taiwan's surrender, China would need to move beyond the gray zone into overt military action. A military blockade would be a key option for China if it seeks to forcefully unify Taiwan without launching an all-out invasion.

Stay tuned for part two of this series, which will explore how China could blockade Taiwan. /squareblack
