## 3 Delegation of Powers

- (a) The powers delegated to a "competent authority' are personal and cannot be exercised by staff officers for or on behalf of the competent authorities specifically named. During the absence of the permanent incumbent on annual leave or other leave, his powers may be exercised by his 'locum tenens' or the officiatinglacting incumbent; as the case may be.

NOTE: When a competent authority is absent on tour; he may permit an officer subordinate to him to sign letters on his behalf. An audit officer will accept the subordinate officer's signature as implying that the orders have been approved by the superior officer provided that the signing officer signs 'for absent on tour'

- (b) A competent authority may, however, permit a selected staff officer holding or officiating in a first grade (Individuals drawing grade pay of ? 5,400/- and above) appointment i.e Lieutenant Colonel and above and their equivalent in the Navy and Air Force to sign "for" him, but in such cases the name of the staff officer selected should be communicated to the audit officer concerned who will accept the subordinate officer's signature as implying that the orders have been approved by the superior officer.
- (c) A competent  authority is, however, personally and unreservedly responsible for any orders purporting to be issued in exercise of the powers delegated by him.
- (d)  Except where expressly permitted by a competent authority; a Controlling Officer may not delegate to a subordinate his duty of countersignature. When powers are so delegated, the responsibility will rest with the Controlling Officer.
- NOTE: The name of the subordinate officer to whom powers are delegated by a Controlling Officer need not be mentioned in the orders of the competent authority granting the

permission but it will suffice if the specific appointment of the officer; to whom the powers are delegated, is mentioned therein.
