## 5.1 Conclusion

This study introduced a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that integrates three distinct pooling strategies: MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling. This approach aimed to leverage the unique advantages of each pooling method to enhance the ability of the model to classify images accurately across a diverse set of datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CT scans, and X-ray images. Our findings demonstrate that by averaging the probabilistic outputs from models utilizing these varied pooling layers, we achieved superior classification performance compared to models that rely on a single type of pooling layer. This improvement is consistently observed across all tested datasets, underscoring the robustness and versatility of the proposed architecture. The significance of the study lies not only in the enhanced accuracy achieved in image classification tasks but also in the demonstration of how pooling layer diversity can contribute to the development of more sophisticated and capable CNN models. By incorporating MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling layers, the proposed model effectively captures both the most salient and the subtlest features within the images, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the visual data. This balance between feature detection capabilities is particularly crucial in challenging classification scenarios, such as the detection of COVID-19 in medical imaging, where both prominent and minute patterns can be indicative of the diagnosis.
