## 5.2 Limitations

The present study introduces several innovative enhancements, but it also faces limitations that merit consideration. Potential challenges include generalization to unseen data due to specific tuning to training datasets, increased computational complexity from integrating multiple pooling strategies, and risks of overfitting with the complexity of the model. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed method has only been validated on a limited image dataset. While the fundamental pooling layer of CNNs suggests potential applicability across different modalities, this study restricts its evaluation to image data, which may limit the broader application of the findings. Other concerns include interpretability issues due to novel pooling layers, scalability challenges for more extensive and more varied datasets, and the intricate parameter tuning required for optimal performance across diverse scenarios, all of which could impact the practical deployment of the model in varied real-world settings.
