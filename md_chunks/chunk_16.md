## 5.3 Future work

The promising results of the study open several avenues for future research, as follows:

- 1) Further exploration into combining different pooling strategies within CNN architectures could yield even more efficient and accurate models. Investigating the impact of varying the proportion of each pooling method's contribution to the final model output may provide insights into optimal configurations for specific image classification tasks.
- 2) Extending the application of our proposed architecture to other domains, such as video analysis, natural language processing, or complex pattern recognition tasks, could demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of the model beyond static image classification. The ability of our model to capture a wide range

of feature activations makes it a promising candidate for these complex applications.

- 3) Integrating emerging deep learning techniques, such as attention mechanisms or generative adversarial networks (GANs), with our pooling strategy could enhance the model's performance. These techniques could provide additional context or augment the training data, potentially improving the ability of the model to generalize from limited or noisy datasets.
- 4) The deployment of the proposed model in real-world applications, particularly in health care for disease detection and progression monitoring tasks, could have significant implications. Further validation and adaptation of the model to meet clinical requirements would be essential steps toward this goal.
