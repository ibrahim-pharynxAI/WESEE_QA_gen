## (a) Preservation of the dead bodies:

The dead body will be embalmed and coffined for the purpose of transportation. The cost of embalming will be restricted to the extent of actual expenditure as charged by the Government Hospital and that of coffin should be the barest minimum on the basis of austerity standards.
