For journeys by rail in foreign counties, Government servants will be entitled to draw the actual fares by the appropriate class and in addition DA at the prescribed rates for each night spent away from the HQ.

HOMs are empowered to grant 'sleeper' accommodation (where such accommodation is available on payment of a supplement to the second class fare) during night journeys by rail of not less than six hours duration to service personnel drawing Grade from 7 4800/-, serving on the staff of the Service AttacheslAdvisers . In countries where second class on the railways do not provide sleeping accommodation in any form, service personnel and member of their families when permitted by Government, in advance to accompany the individual while travelling in the night or not less than six hours may; on the specific authorisation from the HOM, be permitted to travel in first class, provided it has sleeping accommodation. A certificate will be obtained from the HOM or an endorsement on the TA bills to the effect that the amount of expenses claimed was actually incurred. This concession will not be applicable in counties where second class on the railways does provide sleeping accommodation but is not availed of due to the application for reservation or otherwise.
