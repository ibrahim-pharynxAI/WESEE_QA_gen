## WHAT IS A QUARANTINE?

The term quarantine is sometimes used interchangeably with 'blockade.' However, this report differentiates between the two, defining a quarantine as a law enforcement-led operation to control maritime or air traffic within a specific area while a blockade is foremost military in nature. A quarantine would entail China's coast guard and other forces conducting gray zone operations intended to stay below the threshold of an armed conflict. Thus, the military would play a supporting role-not a leading role-in such operations.

The political and operational goals of a quarantine are not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to impose a system of controls over the island's maritime and/or air commerce. In a quarantine, key necessities like food and medicine could continue to flow into Taiwan, enabling China to assert that its law enforcement operation is imposing no hardship. A quarantine could target the delivery of specific goods, such as shipments of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, but such a move would risk provoking a more direct U.S. response.

A key goal of the quarantine approach is to obtain compliance from international companies and other countries to demonstrate China's power over Taiwan. This is similar, in some respects, to China's 2013 declaration of an ADIZ over much of the East China Sea. Many airlines, including U.S. companies, complied with Beijing's demands then.

A quarantine of Taiwan could involve a change of Chinese domestic policy to establish new rules or requirements for regulating trade or traffic into Taiwan, or it could simply involve Chinese law enforcement forces stepping up activities against Taiwan on the basis of existing laws. Thus, a quarantine would focus on forcing compliance with Chinese rules and strengthening China's asserted sovereignty claims over Taiwan.

brief defines a blockade as a military-led operation. China's PLA would be leading a blockade by encircling parts or all of Taiwan, while forces such as the coast guard and maritime militia play a supporting role. More intense versions of a blockade could involve missile strikes against Taiwan as well as mining of waters around Taiwan.

A blockade would, by nature, involve much more escalatory operations than a quarantine. A quarantine would not intentionally involve the use of kinetic force to attack targets, though it is possible that escalation could lead to an exchange of kinetic attacks.

There are no publicly available doctrinal writings on how exactly China could execute a quarantine. However, China has conducted several maneuvers and exercises that are indicative of how it can use law enforcement operations to assert control over traffic to Taiwan and complicate Taiwan's maritime environment.

In August 2022, when then speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China's Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) deployed a large patrol vessel, the Haixun 06 , to conduct operations off the coast of China's Fujian Province and in the Taiwan Strait for the first time. In April 2023, after Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen transited through the United States, the Haixun 06 deployed again. This time, it sailed farther into the Taiwan Strait, and the Fujian Province MSA announced that the vessel would carry out 'on-site inspections' of vessels, though there were no reports that inspections occurred.

More recently, China increased coast guard patrols near Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Islands after an incident there. In February 2024, a Taiwan coast guard vessel chased and collided with a Chinese vessel that Taiwan asserts was illegally fishing near Kinmen. The incident resulted in the death of two crew members. China responded by increasing coast guard patrols near what Taiwan calls 'restricted' and 'prohibited' waters around Kinmen. 2  At one point, Chinese coast guard personnel boarded a Taiwan-owned tourist boat to check its licenses and paperwork.

Around the main island of Taiwan, 'prohibited waters' refers to its territorial waters, which extend 12 nautical miles from Taiwan's territorial baseline; 'restricted waters' refers to its contiguous zone, which extends out 24 nautical miles. Around Kinmen, the 'prohibited waters' extend 300 meters (0.16 nautical miles) and the 'restricted waters' extend 300 meters to the north and out 1,000 meters (0.5 nautical miles) to the south.

ducted drills jointly with the China Coast Guard (CCG). Chinese official outlets described the exercises as simulating 'emergency scenarios' and focusing on enhancing forces' 'interoperability and joint strike capabilities.'

China again stepped up the involvement of the CCG in May 2024 during its latest round of large-scale exercises around Taiwan. Alongside the PLA exercises, the CCG conducted its own operations around two of Taiwan's outlying islands. On the same day that the PLA exercises started, the Fujian Province Coast Guard launched a 'comprehensive law enforcement exercise' in waters around Wuqiu and Dongyin 'to test its joint patrol, rapid reaction and emergency response capabilities.' The CCG indicated that its patrol vessels came as close as 2.8 nautical miles from Wuqiu's islands and as close as 3.1 nautical miles from Dongyin, marking the first time CCG vessels have entered waters there.

showed multiple CCG ships encircling a target vessel and spraying water cannons, though the vessel appeared to be Chinese-flagged, and the video did not show the water cannons actually hitting the vessel. This represents a marked increase in intensity compared to previous CCG activities around Taiwan, and it is the latest and clearest indication that China is preparing its law enforcement and military forces to operate together in the context of a Taiwan Strait crisis.
