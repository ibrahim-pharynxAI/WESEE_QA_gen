## 2.2 Activation function strategy

In our novel approach to activation functions, we propose a dual-path strategy for managing activations within neural networks, specifically designed to preserve and independently process both positive and negative information from feature maps. This approach employs a parallel combination of positive and negative ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) functions, coupled with MaxMinPooling layers, to enhance the network's capacity for comprehensive feature interpretation. Additionally, block-wise concatenation of positive and negative ReLU activations is employed to effectively merge different feature representations, which is crucial for nuanced learning and improving the overall expressiveness of the model.

Moreover, integrating these concatenated activation functions with MaxMinPooling layers facilitates a deeper understanding and more robust feature extraction by maintaining critical spatial hierarchies. This approach not only amplifies the network's sensitivity to diverse input features, but also stabilizes the learning process by balancing the positive and negative influences within the learned representations. The combination has shown promising results in preliminary tests, particularly in complex recognition tasks where traditional models fail to capture subtle but crucial anomalies. The empirical validation of this architecture reveals significant improvements in classification accuracy, confirming its efficacy in practical applications.
