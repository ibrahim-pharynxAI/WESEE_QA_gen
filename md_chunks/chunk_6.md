## CHINA'S ABILITY TO QUARANTINE TAIWAN

A quarantine would be an immense and unprecedented undertaking for China, requiring it to overcome complex logistics hurdles and jointly command law enforcement, maritime militia, and military forces. Nevertheless, China has immense capabilities at its disposal that would enable it to conduct a quarantine.

With over 150 oceangoing vessels and more than 400 smaller vessels at its disposal, the CCG is the largest coast guard in the world. The CCG is a quasi-military organization that reports to China's highest military authority, the Central Military Commission. Many CCG ships were transferred from the navy and still carry some military-grade weapons, such as 76 mm cannons .

Taiwan's coast guard would be at a major quantitative and qualitative disadvantage. It has just 10 oceangoing ships and approximately 160 smaller vessels. These vessels are responsible for protecting the over 300 harbors and ports on Taiwan's coast and for law enforcement activity within 24 nautical miles of the island.

civilian agency responsible for maritime security and navigation, would work alongside the CCG to lead a quarantine. The MSA's fleet consists of at least three dozen oceangoing vessels and hundreds of smaller patrol craft. 3

the dozens or hundreds to defend China's territorial claims in the region.

In addition to the CCG, China also possesses a large maritime militia: a force of organized, trained, and armed personnel aboard fishing vessels and other craft. These vessels operate under the official guise of commercial fishing activity, but in actuality, they work in tandem with China's law enforcement and under the shadow of the PLA to support Chinese maritime operations. Because the maritime militia is not officially a law enforcement or military entity, it is challenging for other countries to respond to its activities.

It is unclear how many Chinese maritime militia operate near the Taiwan Strait, but those that would be involved in a Taiwan contingency may be based at  ports in China's Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong Provinces. Meanwhile, Taiwan does not have an equivalently large force similar to China's maritime militia. This means Taiwan would largely need to lean on its coast guard to respond to militia activity.

There is little information about the full size of the maritime militia, but some estimate that it consists of more than 100 large vessels and as many as 3,000 smaller vessels. The lion's share of the maritime militia is concentrated in the South China Sea, where militia vessels often swarm by

Finally, China's military forces also significantly overshadow Taiwan's. As of 2023, the PLA Navy comprises a battle force of over 370 vessels , many of which are based in areas close to the Taiwan Strait. The PLA Air Force and Navy also boast thousands of aircraft, which support China's ability to project power and conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) around Taiwan. If the situation around Taiwan goes kinetic, Taiwan would face a much larger force than its own, limiting its ability to effectively respond to aggressive Chinese activities.

3 The MSA also likely possesses hundreds or thousands of other craft for operating in internal waterways, such as rivers. These would not be relevant for a contingency around Taiwan.
