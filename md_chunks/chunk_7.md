## 2.3 Probabilistic output fusion

In this research, the integration of the probabilistic outputs of three distinct CNN models-each employing MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling, respectively-forms the core of our strategy to improve image classification accuracy. By averaging these outputs before applying a softmax function to derive final scores, this fusion technique effectively captures a comprehensive spectrum of features from the images, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. This ensemble method not only mitigates individual model biases, but also leverages the diverse strengths of each model, leading to improved generalization and robustness across varied datasets.
