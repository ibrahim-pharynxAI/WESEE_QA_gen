## THE ROLE OF GEOGRAPHY

Geography is a major factor at play in a quarantine scenario. At its narrowest point, the Taiwan Strait is only about 130 km (81 miles) wide, meaning China does not have to deploy forces at long distances from China's own shores.

China. There are two less-busy ports-Hualien and Su'aoon Taiwan's east coast, as well as additional smaller harbors.

Adding to Taiwan's exposure is the fact that the island has only a handful of major international ports. Most of the busiest ports-including Kaohsiung, Taichung, Taipei, Keelung, and Mailiao-are also the closest to mainland

The Port of Kaohsiung stands out among these. In 2022, an estimated 57 percent of Taiwan's maritime trade entered through the Port of Kaohsiung, making it an indispensable commercial hub for the island. 4  It is by far Taiwan's busiest port for containerized goods and oil, and the nearby Yung-An Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal is Taiwan's largest facility for importing LNG.

All  of  this  means it is easier for Chinese forces to reach Taiwan's most important shipping ports. In fact, if China can effectively control traffic into just one port, Kaohsiung, it can achieve significant influence over what gets into Taiwan.
