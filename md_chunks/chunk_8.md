## 2.4 Dataset selection rationale

Toward a comprehensive assessment of CNN models in both basic and complex image recognition tasks, we selected CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, X-ray and CT scan datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed CNN models, each chosen for their unique attributes and relevance to the model's application. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, known for their color images of everyday objects divided into 10 and 100 classes, respectively, are widely utilized in the machine learning community to benchmark image recognition algorithms [43]. These datasets allow us to test the CNN's ability to learn and categorize varied visual features, providing a baseline measure of performance. On the other hand, the X-ray and CT scan datasets are critical in the medical field, especially relevant under current global health conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These medical datasets contain grayscale images that present complex patterns crucial for disease diagnosis, challenging our models to capture subtle nuances that are vital for accurate medical analysis. Sample images from each dataset are shown in Fig. 2. For performance evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, the model used an 80:20 ratio for training and testing of the model performance. The details of X-ray [44-48] and CT scan [49] dataset are tabulated in Table 2.

This broad evaluation of diverse datasets helps demonstrate the generalizability and efficacy of the models across different domains and conditions, confirming their potential for real-world applications, particularly in enhancing automated diagnostic processes. This approach underscores the importance of using diverse datasets in developing models that are robust, versatile, and capable of functioning effectively in various real-world scenarios.
