## 87\_ Transfer whilst on short leave

- An individual to whom Travelling Allowance is admissible and who goes on leave not exceeding 4 months (irrespective of the nature of leave) after he has given over charge of one appointment and before he has taken charge of another is entitled, whether the order of transfer is received before or after the commencement of his leave, to the conveyance which would have been admissible had he remained on duty.

In the case of individual who travel from a station at which he is spending his leave with his family to join a new post by a class lower than the one to which he is entitled, his Travelling Allowance will be regulated as follows

- (1) For Self One fare as from the old duty to the new duty station by the class of accommodation by which the journey was actually made as a result of the transfer.
- (2) For Family For each member one or half fare, as the case may be, as in (i) (1) above.

NOTE: In the case of an individual who proceeds to new duty station travel partly by a lower class and partly by the entitled class of accommodation, one fare referred to in clause 1 above should be calculated partly by the class of accommodation; to which he is entitled and partly by a lower class actually used in proportion to the distance travelled by these classes from the station at which leave was being spent to the new station; even though the total amount actually by the individual is more than what would have been admissible for a direct journey from the old to the new duty station by the appropriate class. paid

- (ii) A service officer who proceeds to his new duty station on permanent transfer via his leave station and who avails of Leave Travel Concessions or uses Form 'D' only will be entitled to travelling concessions as under where 'A' represents the old duty station; 'B' the new duty station and 'C' the leave station.
