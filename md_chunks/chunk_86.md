## 88. Individuals transferred whilst on leave not allowed on return to retain original station

In no case shall an individual who is transferred , whilst on leave be allowed on return to rejoin at his original station unless such a course is ordered in the interest of the public service:

NOTE:

Officers recalled to the original unitl formation from the leave station before proceeding to the new duty station merely for proper handing over of charge; collection of kit and clearance of arrears etc. will not be entitled to any Travelling Allowance for such journeys. However; the authority competent to sanction the leave (other than casual leave) under the leave rules for the service; may permit a service officer transferred to another station while on leave to rejoin duty at the old station if such a course of action is in the public interest.

Where permission to rejoin duty at the old duty station is granted; a copy of that order should invariably be attached to the Travelling Allowance Claim. Travelling Allowance in such cases will be regulated as under:

- (a)  Travel concessions for the return journeys to old duty station will be regulated as if the officer has not been transferred.
- (b) Full permanent duty scale of Travelling Allowance will be from old to the new duty station. paid

The provisions of this rule will not apply to officers proceeding for more than four months irrespective of the nature of leave.
