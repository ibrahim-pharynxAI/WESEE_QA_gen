## SCENARIO 1: LIMITED MARITIME QUARANTINE

In this first scenario, Beijing leverages its law enforcement forces to conduct a limited maritime quarantine of some of Taiwan's ports. This is not aimed at choking off Taiwan's access to trade, but a gray zone operation to achieve more limited-but still significant-objectives.

Days or weeks before the start of quarantine operations, China readies maritime law enforcement forces within its coast guard and MSA. Beijing also mobilizes portions of its military and calls up maritime militia fishing vessels in the area.

China begins by publicly announcing 'enhanced customs inspection rules.' It avoids using terms like 'quarantine' or 'blockade' to describe its actions. In order to enter Taiwan, all cargo and tanker vessels must file advance customs declarations with relevant Chinese authorities.

Chinese law enforcement vessels will be authorized to board vessels, conduct on-site inspections, question personnel, and undertake other measures against noncompliant ships. Chinese authorities also threaten fines and market access restrictions for companies flouting the new rules. 5

The quarantine is set to enter into force 48 hours after announcement. This allows China time to deploy forces into position after they have been mobilized. It also allows shipping companies with vessels in transit warning time to comply, lending some credibility to China's actions.

Chinese authorities do not announce a specific location for the inspections, but they intend to target the Port of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's busiest port. China positions more than 10 law enforcement patrol vessels off the coast of Kaohsiung. China also deploys a smaller contingent of law enforcement vessels within the Taiwan Strait off the coast of other major ports at Taichung and Taipei. About 48 hours after the initial announcement, Chinese authorities issue notices that enforcement is beginning and that its patrol ships will stop noncompliant vessels.

The vessels intrude into Taiwan's 24-nautical-mile contiguous zone and occasionally approach the 12-nautical-mile territorial seas boundary. This is symbolically important since China does not recognize Taiwan's claims to these boundaries. During large-scale military exercises around Taiwan in April 2023, several PLA vessels intruded into Taiwan's contiguous zone in a maneuver intended to delegitimize Taiwan's claims.

Supporting these law enforcement vessels are approximately 20 maritime militia fishing vessels extending along

5 China has adopted legal measures to justify such actions. In 2021, China revised its Maritime Traffic Safety Law to allow it to establish 'prohibited navigation areas.' China also adopted its Coast Guard Law in 2021, which allows the maritime management authorities to forcibly board, inspect, and remove foreign vessels from China's waters and territorial seas.

Taiwan's contiguous zone. These maritime militia vessels are not authorized to conduct boarding or search operations against commercial vessels. Instead, they fill in gaps in ISR and complicate Taiwan's maritime domain awareness by swarming in certain areas. China could deploy significantly more militia forces-as it has done in the South China Sea-but the militia forces are not as well trained as the coast guard, and Beijing may worry about their discipline and ability to face off against Taiwan's coast guard.

While this quarantine is ostensibly a law enforcement operation, the military plays a key supporting role. China's navy deploys five surface action groups (SAGs) to encircle Taiwan from a distance. Each SAG comprises three to six ships-including destroyers, frigates, support vessels, and covertly deployed attack submarines-for a total of nearly 30 warships. They are primarily meant to deter intervention by foreign coast guard or military forces and to respond if Taiwan's navy escalates or attempts to escort vessels into

the island. They also provide ISR, extending China's air and maritime domain awareness farther into the Pacific, helping Beijing monitor U.S., Japanese, or other movements. In addition to naval operations, the PLA constantly flies sorties of manned and unmanned aircraft around Taiwan to monitor traffic.

Beijing does not need universal compliance with the customs rules in order to claim success. Compliance by around 75 percent of shipping companies would be a considerable success for China.

Chinese-flagged shipping vessels-which account for a significant share of the total traffic-universally comply with Chinese authorities, and Beijing permits them to enter Taiwan's ports. Beijing counts on most foreign shipping companies complying with the 'enhanced customs rules' to avoid reprisals, but several companies headquartered in Taiwan, the United States, and certain other countries publicly oppose and disregard the rules. Over the course of one week, Chinese law enforcement vessels only stop and search one or two vessels in total and focus solely on Taiwan-owned vessels.

If China meets relatively limited pushback and most companies comply with Chinese customs rules, China begins to draw down operations after about one week. However, a considerable law enforcement and military presence persists around Taiwan in the weeks that followan indication of the new normal China has established.
