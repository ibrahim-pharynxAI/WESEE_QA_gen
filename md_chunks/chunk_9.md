## 2.5 Architectural design

To effectively evaluate the performance of our proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) models, we designed four custom CNN architectures tailored to each of the four distinct datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, X-ray, and CT scans. For each dataset, the input is passed through three parallel channels of CNN models, each incorporating a different pooling strategy, MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This design allows us to leverage the unique advantages of each pooling method. An important aspect of our approach is the use of positive ReLU activation for MaxPooling, negative ReLU activation for MinPooling, and both positive and negative ReLU activations for MaxMinPooling. This configuration helps preserve both positive and negative relevant features, enhancing ability of the model to capture a broad spectrum of data characteristics. The outputs from these three channels are then averaged and processed through a softmax function to calculate the final classification scores. These scores are compared with the true labels to evaluate the overall performance of the model.
