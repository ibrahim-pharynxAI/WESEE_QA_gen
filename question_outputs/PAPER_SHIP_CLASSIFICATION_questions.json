This vast maritime traffic needs to be managed and monitored by identifying and recognising vessels to ensure the maritime safety and security. As an approach to find an automated and efficient solution, a deep learning model exploiting convolutional neural network (CNN) as a basic building block, has been proposed in this paper.

INTRODUCTION\n\nApart from their conventional roles, modern naval forces are  also  actively  involved  in  maritime  security  operations, including  monitoring,  tracking,  detecting,  and  identifying ocean traffic, efficiently and effectively.\n\nAI has turned up as one of the most promising technologies across diverse fields. In this paper, CNN based deep learning algorithm has been studied, and its performance is evaluated and analysed.\n\nVessel movements are currently monitored using automatic  identification  system  (AIS) 1 , synthetic aperture radar  (SAR) 2 ,  satellite-based  images 3-4 ,  and  optical  images captured by cameras. SAR or satellite images give the full view of maritime vessels and cover larger ocean areas than optical images.  For  maritime  surveillance,  the  optical  image-based classification would be an efficient solution due to its simplicity and easy availability. However, its successful realisation using conventional methods faces many challenges such as degraded quality of images due to environmental factors, the resemblance in the look and form of the class of ships, and the vastness of the ocean environment.\n\nThese factors call for a more reliable technology or system which can automatically classify ships based on their features, where artificial intelligence (AI) can play a significant role. AI system is capable of automatic identification and recognition of marine vessels and objects around it, like navigation-aids, boats, etc. that can lead to the enhanced situational awareness.\n",

Schematic representation  of  convolution  operation  in  a convolutional layer.\n\nIt is very uncommon to train a convolutional network from scratch because it needs a sufficiently large training dataset and GPU to execute and evaluate the deep learning model. Alternatively, a transfer learning approach can be used for a new classification task.

It  consists  of  fully  connected  layers  as  a  regular artificial neural network followed by a Softmax layer (final  output  layer)  that  provides  the  class  scores. It  consists  of  input  layer,  output  layer  and  number of hidden layers as shown in Fig. 4. The number of hidden layers and number of nodes in each layer are Hyperparameters.\n\nFigure 3.

Due  to  the  inadequacy of  a  sufficiently  large  dataset  and  GPU  availability,  transfer learning has been used in the present study considering Case 3 for implementation.\n\nblocks  can  be  used  as  it  is  for  the  particular classification task. Therefore, to make the VGG16 model more relevant and specific to the classification of ship's images, the last convolution block of the VGG16 network has been re-trained. However,  a  relatively  small  number  of  images in  the  training  of  the  model  leads  to  overfitting of  the  model  that  has  been  verified  empirically also.  To  mitigate  this  issue,  we  have  used  two important process improvement techniques; the  first  is  'batchNormalisation'. The  second  is 'Dropout.' It is pertinent to mention that process improvement techniques, batchNormalisation and Dropout, were not implemented in the standard VGG16 model.\n\nProcess improvement techniques cannot be incorporated directly into the pretrained convolutional  blocks  of  the  standard  VGG16\n\nThere are several freely accessible top-performing models,  like  VGG16 9 ,  ResNet50 10 ,  Inception 11 ,  Xception 12 , InceptionResNet 13 ,  and  DenseNet 14 ,  which  can  be  readily integrated  into  a  new  image  recognition  task.  In  the  present study,  the  transfer  learning  approach  based  on  the  standard VGG16 model  has  been  used  as  a  baseline  model  for  ship image  classification.  Originally,  VGG16  was  trained  using ImageNet  that  consists  of  millions  of  images  with  1000 categories. In our study, the marine vessel images are smaller in  numbers and dissimilar in relation to the original dataset. Therefore, the standard VGG16 could not be used as a fixed feature extractor, where pretrained weights of the convolutional model.  Therefore,  an  additional  convolutional  block  similar to  the  convolutional  blocks  of  standard  VGG16  has  been appended  in  the  proposed  model  to  incorporate  process improvement techniques. An extra convolutional block would also lead to learning more specific features of the input training  dataset  as  the  convolutional  layer  goes  into  deeper stages. Process improvement  techniques have also been incorporated into the classification block consisting of FullyConnected layers. The VGG16 model has been further built upon  by  data  augmentation  and  fine-tuning  of  the  network Hyperparameters. Proposed model has been evaluated against the baseline model.\n",

Data augmentation has been applied very carefully to generate a  new  set  of  images  to  augment  the  training  dataset  while preserving  the  basic  features.  The  various  kinds  of  random variations incorporated into the training dataset include zooming, rotation, shift, and horizontal/vertical flips.\n\n(b)  Re-train  the  weights  of  the  VGG16  model: VGG16 was designed to extract fine-grained features of objects from 1,000 categories. As the higher-order features learned by the model corresponds to the ImageNet dataset that may not be directly relevant to the classification of optical images of the ships, we have re-trained some convolution blocks of VGG16 to fine-tune the weights for our classification task.\n\n(c) Fine-Tuning the Model: Following Hyperparameters have  been  fine-tuned  to  improve  the  performance  of  the baseline model:\n\n- (i) Number  of Layers: Classification accuracy may  be improved by increasing the number of hidden layers and\n\nFigure 7. Process flow architecture of standard VGG16 model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnumbers of nodes in each layer as it enhances the model capacity. However, it has been observed empirically that a deeper network lead to the overfitting of the model, higher complexity, and more training time due to the increased number of learnable parameters. Therefore, the impact of the number of hidden layers and nodes in each layer is evaluated empirically, and optimal numbers were chosen accordingly.\n\n- (ii) Learning Rates: learning rate is one of the vital Hyperparameter  that  needs  careful  selection.  Through experiments, it has been observed that a small learning rate  causes  the  trapping  and  slow  down  of  the learning  process;  whereas,  a  large  value  of  learning rate leads to quick and non-optimal convergence. An optimal  value  of  the  learning  rate  has  been  chosen empirically.\n- (c) batch Normalisation and Dropout have been embedded into the block-6 consisting of fully connected layers.\n\nThe process flow architecture of the proposed model is presented in Fig. 8.\n",

    "content": "## 5.    CONCLUSION\n\nIn the present study, ship classification has been addressed using  VGG16  based  transfer  learning  architecture.  Further, the addition of several performance improvement techniques and fine-tuning of neural network Hyperparameters have been carried  out  to  improve  the  baseline  model.  Evaluation  and analysis of the proposed model have been carried out for four categories of ship images using a limited dataset. CNN based proposed model shows promising results with a classification accuracy of 97.08%, making it suitable for maritime security applications.\n\nIn all the experiments, it has been assumed that the input images belong only to one of the four categories. However, if the input image does not belong to any of the four categories, it  can  be  classified  as  a  member  of  the  'unknown'  class  by assigning  a  suitable  threshold  value  (say,  0.5)  to  the  class scores.  Class  scores  is  the  values  of  associated  probabilities at the output of Softmax layer that is the final output layer in artificial neural network. If the value of the highest class score is  lower than the threshold value, then that particular output can be marked as 'unknown' class.\n\nAs a future work, this model can be further fine-tuned for use with satellite-based or SAR based ship images to create a robust system for ship classification. The study can be further extended to the case of multiple ships or objects in each input image.\n",
