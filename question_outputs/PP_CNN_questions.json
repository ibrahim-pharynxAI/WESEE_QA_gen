    "content": "## 1 Introduction\n\nThe convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent a significant innovation in deep learning, designed to address the complexities of image classification [1, 2]. Inspired by the structure of the human visual cortex, CNNs mimic the hierarchical processing of visual information, allowing them to manage spatial hierarchies in data effectively. This architecture is particularly suited for analyzing and interpreting visual imagery across various applications, making CNNs exceptionally effective for these tasks [3].\n\n&amp; Pushpendra Singh spushp@jnu.ac.in\n\nNarendra Kumar Mishra eez188568@ee.iitd.ac.in\n\nAnubha Gupta anubha@iiitd.ac.in\n\nShiv Dutt Joshi sdjoshi@iitd.ac.in\n\n- 1 Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Delhi, Delhi, India\n- 2 School of Engineering, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, India\n- 3 SBILab, Department of ECE, IIT-Delhi, Delhi, India\n\nCNNs have become foundational in computer vision because they can automate feature extraction. Unlike traditional image processing techniques that require manual feature selection and careful engineering, CNNs learn to identify relevant features directly from the data. This capability has revolutionized image classification, enabling substantial advancements in object recognition, video, and medical image analysis. By learning to detect features from training data, CNNs have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of image classification tasks [4].\n\nRecent advancements in medical image classification have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN-based architectures for diagnosing various diseases. Akyol [5] introduced a two-stage voting framework for COVID-19 detection, while Kurt et al. [6] applied EfficientNet models for analyzing lung parenchyma to detect COVID-19, achieving promising results. Kibriya and Amin [7] further\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nenhanced COVID-19 detection with a residual networkbased framework using chest X-ray images. Additionally, CNN models have also been widely applied for cancer detection. Sahu et al. [8] proposed a hybrid CNN classifier for breast cancer detection using mammogram and ultrasound datasets, achieving high classification accuracy. Mridha et al. [9] tackled skin cancer classification with explainable AI models, employing optimized CNN architectures for interpretability. Diabetic retinopathy detection using deep learning ensemble approaches has also shown significant promise, as demonstrated by Qummar et al. [10]. Furthermore, Oguz et al. [11] developed a CNNbased hybrid model to detect glaucoma disease from medical images effectively, showcasing the broad applicability of CNNs across various medical image classification tasks.\n\nCNNs are distinguished by their deep architecture, which consists of several layers of fundamental building blocks arranged in various patterns. The core components of a CNN, illustrated in Fig. 1, are each designed to process different aspects of input data [12]. These layers work in tandem to extract and refine features, enabling the network to perform complex image analysis tasks effectively. The convolutional layers apply filters to the input, creating feature maps highlighting key patterns. The activation layers like ReLU introduce nonlinearity, enabling the model to learn complex data relationships. The pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions, improving efficiency while retaining important features. In the final stages, the dense layers interpret high-level features and produce predictions, with the softmax layer converting outputs into class probabilities. The output layer delivers the final classification, such as distinguishing COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia.\n\nRecognizing the limitations of MaxPooling, especially its tendency to overlook less dominant features, there is a strong impetus to explore novel pooling strategies that preserve a more comprehensive set of information, thus potentially enhancing the overall performance of the network. Recent research underscores the potential benefits of utilizing diverse pooling strategies, including better generalization capabilities of networks from training datasets to unseen data [16-18], eventually enhancing their performance and applicability in real-world applications. For example, MinPooling captures the minimum values within the receptive field, which can be critical in scenarios where these lesser values contain important contrasts or details, such as images with subtle variations in shading or lighting. An innovative solution to leverage the strengths of both MaxPooling and MinPooling is the development of MaxMinPooling. This approach integrates outputs from both pooling strategies, preserving the highest and lowest values in the feature map. Such integration ensures that no critical details are overlooked, providing a balanced and detailed representation of the image data.\n\nIn traditional CNNs, MaxPooling is a widely utilized technique that processes the input by extracting the maximum value from each segment of an image covered by the kernel [13]. While MaxPooling effectively highlights the most prominent features, it can result in the loss of potentially important details [14]. This loss is particularly significant in fields like medical imaging, where every pixel may carry crucial diagnostic information [15].\n\nJun Park et al. [19] introduced conditional MinPooling (CMP) to enhance CNN feature representation by preserving critical features through a tolerance mechanism. Their approach restructures CNNs by combining CMP with MaxPooling and applying a 1 /C2 1 convolution to reduce channel dimensions before pooling. This technique captures diverse features and improves robustness. Evaluated on Caltech 101 and custom datasets, CMP increased accuracy by 0.16 /C0 0.52% and decreased loss by 19.98 /C0 28.71% compared to traditional methods. Vienken, in his master thesis [20], proposed to enhance the efficiency of CNNs through multi-scale convolution filters and MinMaxPooling. This approach captures key features while being noise-resistant, addressing the computational complexity of deeper CNNs. Experiments showed that the MinMax method improved accuracy by 0.71% on CIFAR10 and 4.9% on the Places dataset compared to the traditional methods.\n\nOne innovative approach, presented by Ozdemir, is the Avg-TopK pooling method that computes the weighted average of the most significant features by focusing on the\n\nFig. 1 Architecture of a typical CNN model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntop K amplitude pixels [21]. Zhao et al. further modified this pooling strategy and introduced T-Max-Avg pool layer, which allows flexibility in feature extraction by using a threshold parameter to select the most representational/ interactive pixels, enabling the maximum value or the weighted average of the top pixels to be pooled via threshold T based on data characteristics [18].\n\nFurther studies include Yu et al.'s mixed pooling method, which introduces variability by alternating between MaxPooling and average pooling in a stochastic manner, thereby enhancing regularization [22]. Er et al. have developed an attention pooling scheme that uses outputs from a bidirectional LSTM as a reference to weigh features extracted by convolutional layers, ensuring that critical information is preserved during the pooling process [23]. Cui et al. have proposed a general kernel pooling framework that leverages higher-order interactions of features through kernel approximations like the Gaussian RBF, thus capturing more complex patterns without extensive parameterization [24]. Williams et al. introduced wavelet pooling, which employs a multi-level decomposition strategy to refine feature processing by discarding less critical subbands, thus focusing on more relevant data [25].\n\nJie et al. explored dynamic pooling with their RunPool layer, which adapts the pooling operation dynamically to suit the training data's demands better [26]. Lastly, Sharma et al. introduced a novel method using fuzzy logic to perform dimension reduction, effectively shrinking the spatial size of convolved features while retaining essential information [27]. In a comprehensive review, Nirthika et al. discuss various pooling techniques across computer vision and medical image analysis, highlighting the breadth of research and the potential for these methods to improve CNN performance [28].\n\nPiyush Satti et al. [29] designed a MinMax average pooling-based filter for effectively removing salt and pepper noise from images. This method combines Max- and MinPooling to better preserve edges and enhance the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), particularly in medical images corrupted by medium to high noise densities. Another study by Liyanage et al. [30] focused on hyperspectral image band selection and utilized various pooling methods, including Max- and average pooling, to reduce spectral dimensionality while retaining crucial spectral information. This method enhances classification accuracy and efficiency by addressing the limitations of traditional MaxPooling, ensuring the preservation of essential spectral details. Prior literature work is summarized in Table 1.\n\nMotivated by the above discussion, this study aims to significantly enhance the performance of CNN-based models for image classification through innovative architectural enhancements. We aim to address the limitations of traditional CNN models by introducing refined pooling strategies that improve the accuracy and robustness of classification in various imaging contexts. The significant contributions of the study are as follows:\n\n- 1) Novel MaxMinPooling Architecture with Dual-Activation Function Approach: We have developed an innovative pooling architecture within the traditional CNN framework, termed MaxMinPooling. This architecture enhances feature extraction by uniquely combining the outputs from MaxPooling and MinPooling layers through interleaving, effectively merging the most and least activated pixels from the feature map. This method enriches the input for subsequent layers, improving the model's ability to capture detailed and nuanced features essential for accurate classification.\n- 2) To enhance the effectiveness of the MaxMinPooling layer, we incorporate both positive ReLU max ð 0 ; x Þ and Negative ReLU min ð 0 ; x Þ activation functions and concatenate their outputs within the CNN architecture. This inclusion allows the layer to retain significant positive and negative features, ensuring a more comprehensive and nuanced feature representation. The dual-activation approach captures a broader range of data characteristics, which is essential for high-fidelity applications in image analysis, such as precise medical diagnostics and other complex imaging tasks.\n- 3) Fusion of Probabilistic Outputs: We have integrated the probabilistic outputs from three specialized CNN architectures-each characterized by a distinct pooling layer: MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling. By averaging these probabilities, we harness the diverse strengths of each pooling method, which enhances the overall stability and accuracy of the model. This ensembling effectively mitigates the weaknesses of individual architectures, leading to superior performance and better generalizability of the architecture across various datasets.\n- 4) Comprehensive Performance Evaluation: The efficacy of the proposed model is demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation across on four diverse datasets. We assess the model's performance on standard benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as on specialized medical imaging datasets, including X-rays and CT scans for the detection of COVID-19 disease [31]. The CIFAR datasets were selected due to their widespread use in benchmarking image classification models, providing a reliable measure of the performance of the model against established standards. The inclusion of CT scan and X-ray images addresses the urgent need for automated tools in managing the\n\nTable 1 Summary of recent pooling techniques used in CNNs.

    "content": "## 2.1 Theoretical framework\n\nThe CNN architecture has been pivotal in advancing the field of image recognition due to its ability to learn hierarchical feature representations. At the heart of these advancements are pooling layers, which reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, thus decreasing computational complexity and enhancing the network's ability to capture dominant features. In this study, we explore the integration of three distinct pooling strategies, namely MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling, each contributing uniquely to the robustness and accuracy of image classification tasks. This study elucidates the rationale behind the choice of these specific pooling layers and their collective impact on the proposed CNN model's performance.\n\n- MaxPooling: MaxPooling is a standard pooling operation used in CNNs to down-sample the input's spatial dimensions by taking the maximum value over a specified window for each channel independently. This operation is instrumental in achieving translation invariance, reducing the sensitivity of the output to minor changes and shifts in the input image. By focusing on the most prominent features within each window, MaxPooling, along with positive ReLU, helps in accentuating features that are crucial for discrimination, thus improving the model's generalization capability [38, 39]. However, while effective in highlighting the strongest features, MaxPooling may overlook subtler, yet equally important, features present in the input.\n- MinPooling: In contrast to MaxPooling, MinPooling operates by selecting the minimum value within each pooling window. This approach is less common in traditional CNN architectures but offers unique advantages, particularly in emphasizing low-intensity features that may be overshadowed by more dominant features in the MaxPooling process. By capturing these minimal values, MinPooling along with negative ReLU function can enhance the model's sensitivity to finer and more subtle patterns in the input data, which are often crucial in complex classification tasks, such as distinguishing between similar classes or identifying pathologies in medical images.\n- MaxMinPooling: MaxMinPooling is a novel pooling strategy that aims to combine the strengths of MaxPooling and MinPooling by concurrently capturing both the maximum and minimum values within each pooling window. This dual approach allows the model to retain both the most and least activated features within the input feature map, offering a more comprehensive representation of the input's characteristics. The\n\nintegration of MaxMinPooling is motivated by the hypothesis that a richer feature set, encompassing both extremes of the feature activation spectrum, can significantly enhance the model's discrimination power, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation between classes.\n\nThe interleaved MaxPooling and MinPooling operations are structured such that each MaxPooling output is immediately followed by its corresponding MinPooling output. This configuration ensures an intricate balance and detailed preservation of feature information, allowing the network to capture both high- and low-intensity features of the input. Theoretical analysis suggests that this interleaving can improve gradient flow in deep networks by providing additional gradients during backpropagation [40-42]. We empirically validate this hypothesis through a series of experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved classification accuracy, particularly in scenarios where feature contrasts are critical to performance.\n",

    "content": "## 2.2 Activation function strategy\n\nIn our novel approach to activation functions, we propose a dual-path strategy for managing activations within neural networks, specifically designed to preserve and independently process both positive and negative information from feature maps. This approach employs a parallel combination of positive and negative ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) functions, coupled with MaxMinPooling layers, to enhance the network's capacity for comprehensive feature interpretation. Additionally, block-wise concatenation of positive and negative ReLU activations is employed to effectively merge different feature representations, which is crucial for nuanced learning and improving the overall expressiveness of the model.\n\nMoreover, integrating these concatenated activation functions with MaxMinPooling layers facilitates a deeper understanding and more robust feature extraction by maintaining critical spatial hierarchies. This approach not only amplifies the network's sensitivity to diverse input features, but also stabilizes the learning process by balancing the positive and negative influences within the learned representations. The combination has shown promising results in preliminary tests, particularly in complex recognition tasks where traditional models fail to capture subtle but crucial anomalies. The empirical validation of this architecture reveals significant improvements in classification accuracy, confirming its efficacy in practical applications.\n",

The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, known for their color images of everyday objects divided into 10 and 100 classes, respectively, are widely utilized in the machine learning community to benchmark image recognition algorithms [43]. These datasets allow us to test the CNN's ability to learn and categorize varied visual features, providing a baseline measure of performance. On the other hand, the X-ray and CT scan datasets are critical in the medical field, especially relevant under current global health conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These medical datasets contain grayscale images that present complex patterns crucial for disease diagnosis, challenging our models to capture subtle nuances that are vital for accurate medical analysis. Sample images from each dataset are shown in Fig. 2. For performance evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, the model used an 80:20 ratio for training and testing of the model performance. The details of X-ray [44-48] and CT scan [49] dataset are tabulated in Table 2.\n\nThis broad evaluation of diverse datasets helps demonstrate the generalizability and efficacy of the models across different domains and conditions, confirming their potential for real-world applications, particularly in enhancing automated diagnostic processes. This approach underscores the importance of using diverse datasets in developing models that are robust, versatile, and capable of functioning effectively in various real-world scenarios.\n",

For each dataset, the input is passed through three parallel channels of CNN models, each incorporating a different pooling strategy, MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This design allows us to leverage the unique advantages of each pooling method. An important aspect of our approach is the use of positive ReLU activation for MaxPooling, negative ReLU activation for MinPooling, and both positive and negative ReLU activations for MaxMinPooling. This configuration helps preserve both positive and negative relevant features, enhancing ability of the model to capture a broad spectrum of data characteristics. The outputs from these three channels are then averaged and processed through a softmax function to calculate the final classification scores.

The diagram (refer Fig. 4) shows the flow of data starting with convolution, which extracts features from the input. These features are processed through positive ReLU (PosReLU) and negative ReLU (NegReLU) functions, resulting in distinct feature maps for each type of activation. The feature maps are then concatenated block-wise, preserving both positive and negative activations for further processing, thus providing a richer feature representation.

    "content": "## 4 Results analysis and discussion\n\nThis section details the classification accuracies obtained by the three distinct models-each employing MaxPooling, MinPooling, and our novel MaxMinPooling layers-across four different datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, X-ray, and CT scan images. Performance metrics for each model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, are systematically presented in Tables 4 and 5. The tables provide a clear and concise comparison of the performance of each pooling strategy across the datasets, supporting the ablation study. Additionally, these comparisons are visually represented in a bar chart (Fig. 7), enhancing the interpretability of the data and providing clear insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each pooling method under different conditions.\n\nNotably, enhancements from the probabilistic average method over traditional MaxPooling show an increment of 1.36% for CIFAR-10, whereas a more substantial improvement of 5.65% is observed for CIFAR-100. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining MaxMinPooling with probabilistic averaging to boost the performance of MaxPooling-based neural networks. The method's efficacy was further tested on medical images such as X-rays and CT scans, specifically for distinguishing COVID-19 cases from healthy and pneumonia instances. While the proposed pooling method showed significant improvements in MaxMinPooling over MaxPooling, the gains were less pronounced when utilizing probabilistic fusion methods in medical image datasets. This could have been because probabilistic averaging may introduce noise or dilute critical features, which are essential for the precision required in medical image classification. However, it\n\nFig. 7 Grad-CAM analysis of the MaxMinPooling model on six CT scan images.

This increase in feature map size elevates the computational complexity of the model. However, in many AI applications, such as COVID-19 image classification, the precision of detection outweighs the need for real-time processing. Such enhancements are crucial as they lead to improved generalization of the AI solutions in scenarios where accuracy is more critical than computational speed. Through experimental study, it has been observed that the change of order of MaxPooling and MinPooling, while concatenating the outputs in MaxMinPooling, yields almost similar classification performance. The detailed results are included in the ablation study of Tables 4 and 5 under ''MinMaxPooling,'' which further validate that the sequence of pooling operations has a negligible effect on the overall model accuracy.\n\nFig. 11 Confusion matrices for detection of COVID-19 using the proposed MaxMinPooling method\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig. 10 Confusion matrix for CIFAR-10 image classification using the proposed MaxMinPooling method\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur extensive performance analysis in various datasets illustrates the benefits of integrating MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling strategies. This integration enables the model to capture a broader and more nuanced spectrum of features from the input data. The study details how the model leverages high activation features typically accentuated by MaxPooling along with the subtler features often highlighted by MinPooling. This synergistic approach in the MaxMinPooling2D model enhances the overall feature representation and improves classification performance. These findings underscore the potential of the model in applications that require high levels of accuracy, providing valuable insight into its utility to improve automated AI solutions.\n\nthat strongly influence the predictions of the model. In Fig. 11, we present six CT scan images processed by the MaxMinPooling model, with two examples from each category. The heatmaps reveal the critical areas that contribute to the classification, where warmer colors correspond to higher activations. Upon closer examination, distinct heatmap patterns emerge for each category, providing valuable information for medical practitioners to further analyze the reasoning behind the classification. This method enhances the interpretability of AI models, offering a transparent visualization of the model's reasoning, which is crucial for building trust in AI-driven medical diagnostics.\n\nWe employed Grad-CAM (gradient-weighted class activation mapping) to gain insights into the decisionmaking process of our CNN model when classifying CT scan images. Grad-CAM highlights the regions of an image\n\nIn our study, we have drawn comparisons with several notable advancements in CNN pooling techniques from the literature, particularly focusing on their impact on classification accuracy. For instance, Ozdemir achieved\n\nsignificant improvements, enhancing CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 accuracies by 6.28% and 7.76%, respectively, compared to traditional MaxPooling [21]. Similarly, Yu et al. reported an improvement in the CIFAR-10 test accuracy to 89.20% using a mixed pooling method, outperforming the 88.64% accuracy from MaxPooling [22]. These studies underscore the potential of alternative pooling methods in enhancing classification performance.\n\nOur research integrates MaxPooling, MinPooling, and our novel MaxMinPooling strategies within a unified model framework. This integrated approach not only leverages the strengths of each pooling method, but also addresses the gaps noted in the single-strategy pooling models. For example, Williams et al. and Zhao et al. also reported marginal improvements using new pooling methods over MaxPooling, with Williams et al. reaching an accuracy of 81.15% on CIFAR-10 [25], and Zhao et al. enhancing CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 accuracies by 4.11% and 4.32% [18]. In contrast, our integrated model consistently demonstrates superior performance, showcasing more robust and versatile capabilities across different datasets, including medical imaging datasets critical for COVID-19 detection.\n\nThese comparative analyses highlight the efficacy of our novel integrated pooling approach, indicating an improvement over traditional methods and setting a new benchmark in the utilization of CNNs for complex image classification tasks. This juxtaposition with previous studies establishes the significant strides our methodology offers beyond the current state-of-the-art, particularly in applications demanding high accuracy and reliability.\n",

    "content": "## 5.1 Conclusion\n\nThis study introduced a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that integrates three distinct pooling strategies: MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling. This approach aimed to leverage the unique advantages of each pooling method to enhance the ability of the model to classify images accurately across a diverse set of datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CT scans, and X-ray images. Our findings demonstrate that by averaging the probabilistic outputs from models utilizing these varied pooling layers, we achieved superior classification performance compared to models that rely on a single type of pooling layer. This improvement is consistently observed across all tested datasets, underscoring the robustness and versatility of the proposed architecture. The significance of the study lies not only in the enhanced accuracy achieved in image classification tasks but also in the demonstration of how pooling layer diversity can contribute to the development of more sophisticated and capable CNN models. By incorporating MaxPooling, MinPooling, and MaxMinPooling layers, the proposed model effectively captures both the most salient and the subtlest features within the images, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the visual data. This balance between feature detection capabilities is particularly crucial in challenging classification scenarios, such as the detection of COVID-19 in medical imaging, where both prominent and minute patterns can be indicative of the diagnosis.\n",
