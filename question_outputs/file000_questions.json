Much attention has been paid to the threat of an invasion, but Beijing has options besides invading to coerce, punish, or annex Taiwan. One major step China could take is a 'gray zone' quarantine led not by its People's Liberation Army (PLA) but by its coast guard and other law enforcement forces. Rather than sealing off the island, a quarantine would aim to demonstrate China's ability to exert control over Taiwan. A quarantine is more feasible for China and more likely than an invasion or blockade in the near term; it also presents unique challenges in terms of how Taiwan and the international community can respond. This brief explores two hypothetical maritime quarantine scenarios that are informed by in-depth research, tabletop exercises, private consultations, and expert surveys conducted by the CSIS China Power Project. This brief is accompanied by an interactive digital report visualizing these scenarios.\n",

    "content": "## WHAT IS A QUARANTINE?\n\nThe term quarantine is sometimes used interchangeably with 'blockade.' However, this report differentiates between the two, defining a quarantine as a law enforcement-led operation to control maritime or air traffic within a specific area while a blockade is foremost military in nature. A quarantine would entail China's coast guard and other forces conducting gray zone operations intended to stay below the threshold of an armed conflict. Thus, the military would play a supporting role-not a leading role-in such operations.\n\nThe political and operational goals of a quarantine are not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to impose a system of controls over the island's maritime and/or air commerce. In a quarantine, key necessities like food and medicine could continue to flow into Taiwan, enabling China to assert that its law enforcement operation is imposing no hardship. A quarantine could target the delivery of specific goods, such as shipments of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, but such a move would risk provoking a more direct U.S. response.\n\nA key goal of the quarantine approach is to obtain compliance from international companies and other countries to demonstrate China's power over Taiwan. This is similar, in some respects, to China's 2013 declaration of an ADIZ over much of the East China Sea. Many airlines, including U.S. companies, complied with Beijing's demands then.\n\nA quarantine of Taiwan could involve a change of Chinese domestic policy to establish new rules or requirements for regulating trade or traffic into Taiwan, or it could simply involve Chinese law enforcement forces stepping up activities against Taiwan on the basis of existing laws. Thus, a quarantine would focus on forcing compliance with Chinese rules and strengthening China's asserted sovereignty claims over Taiwan.\n\nbrief defines a blockade as a military-led operation. China's PLA would be leading a blockade by encircling parts or all of Taiwan, while forces such as the coast guard and maritime militia play a supporting role. More intense versions of a blockade could involve missile strikes against Taiwan as well as mining of waters around Taiwan.\n\nA blockade would, by nature, involve much more escalatory operations than a quarantine. A quarantine would not intentionally involve the use of kinetic force to attack targets, though it is possible that escalation could lead to an exchange of kinetic attacks.\n\nThere are no publicly available doctrinal writings on how exactly China could execute a quarantine. However, China has conducted several maneuvers and exercises that are indicative of how it can use law enforcement operations to assert control over traffic to Taiwan and complicate Taiwan's maritime environment.\n\nIn August 2022, when then speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China's Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) deployed a large patrol vessel, the Haixun 06 , to conduct operations off the coast of China's Fujian Province and in the Taiwan Strait for the first time. In April 2023, after Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen transited through the United States, the Haixun 06 deployed again. This time, it sailed farther into the Taiwan Strait, and the Fujian Province MSA announced that the vessel would carry out 'on-site inspections' of vessels, though there were no reports that inspections occurred.\n\nMore recently, China increased coast guard patrols near Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Islands after an incident there. In February 2024, a Taiwan coast guard vessel chased and collided with a Chinese vessel that Taiwan asserts was illegally fishing near Kinmen. The incident resulted in the death of two crew members. China responded by increasing coast guard patrols near what Taiwan calls 'restricted' and 'prohibited' waters around Kinmen. 2  At one point, Chinese coast guard personnel boarded a Taiwan-owned tourist boat to check its licenses and paperwork.\n\nIn contrast to law enforcement-led quarantines, this\n\nAmid this uptick in activity around Kinmen, China conducted a series of combat activities in which naval and air forces from the PLA Eastern Theater Command con-\n\n2 Taiwan claims zones of 'prohibited' and 'restricted' waters. Around the main island of Taiwan, 'prohibited waters' refers to its territorial waters, which extend 12 nautical miles from Taiwan's territorial baseline; 'restricted waters' refers to its contiguous zone, which extends out 24 nautical miles. Around Kinmen, the 'prohibited waters' extend 300 meters (0.16 nautical miles) and the 'restricted waters' extend 300 meters to the north and out 1,000 meters (0.5 nautical miles) to the south.\n\n|\n\nducted drills jointly with the China Coast Guard (CCG). Chinese official outlets described the exercises as simulating 'emergency scenarios' and focusing on enhancing forces' 'interoperability and joint strike capabilities.'\n\nChina again stepped up the involvement of the CCG in May 2024 during its latest round of large-scale exercises around Taiwan. Alongside the PLA exercises, the CCG conducted its own operations around two of Taiwan's outlying islands. On the same day that the PLA exercises started, the Fujian Province Coast Guard launched a 'comprehensive law enforcement exercise' in waters around Wuqiu and Dongyin 'to test its joint patrol, rapid reaction and emergency response capabilities.' The CCG indicated that its patrol vessels came as close as 2.8 nautical miles from Wuqiu's islands and as close as 3.1 nautical miles from Dongyin, marking the first time CCG vessels have entered waters there.\n\nshowed multiple CCG ships encircling a target vessel and spraying water cannons, though the vessel appeared to be Chinese-flagged, and the video did not show the water cannons actually hitting the vessel. This represents a marked increase in intensity compared to previous CCG activities around Taiwan, and it is the latest and clearest indication that China is preparing its law enforcement and military forces to operate together in the context of a Taiwan Strait crisis.\n",

    "content": "## CHINA'S ABILITY TO QUARANTINE TAIWAN\n\nA quarantine would be an immense and unprecedented undertaking for China, requiring it to overcome complex logistics hurdles and jointly command law enforcement, maritime militia, and military forces. Nevertheless, China has immense capabilities at its disposal that would enable it to conduct a quarantine.\n\nWith over 150 oceangoing vessels and more than 400 smaller vessels at its disposal, the CCG is the largest coast guard in the world. The CCG is a quasi-military organization that reports to China's highest military authority, the Central Military Commission. Many CCG ships were transferred from the navy and still carry some military-grade weapons, such as 76 mm cannons .\n\nTaiwan's coast guard would be at a major quantitative and qualitative disadvantage. It has just 10 oceangoing ships and approximately 160 smaller vessels. These vessels are responsible for protecting the over 300 harbors and ports on Taiwan's coast and for law enforcement activity within 24 nautical miles of the island.\n\nChina's MSA, which is the primary non-coast guard\n\n|\n\nFigure 2: China's Coast Guard Advantage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: Each circle represents one ship, sized by approximate displacement.\n\nSource: International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), The Military Balance 2024 (Routledge, 2024), https://www.iiss.org/en/publications/ the-military-balance/.\n\ncivilian agency responsible for maritime security and navigation, would work alongside the CCG to lead a quarantine. The MSA's fleet consists of at least three dozen oceangoing vessels and hundreds of smaller patrol craft. 3\n\nthe dozens or hundreds to defend China's territorial claims in the region.\n\nIn addition to the CCG, China also possesses a large maritime militia: a force of organized, trained, and armed personnel aboard fishing vessels and other craft. These vessels operate under the official guise of commercial fishing activity, but in actuality, they work in tandem with China's law enforcement and under the shadow of the PLA to support Chinese maritime operations. Because the maritime militia is not officially a law enforcement or military entity, it is challenging for other countries to respond to its activities.\n\nIt is unclear how many Chinese maritime militia operate near the Taiwan Strait, but those that would be involved in a Taiwan contingency may be based at  ports in China's Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong Provinces. Meanwhile, Taiwan does not have an equivalently large force similar to China's maritime militia. This means Taiwan would largely need to lean on its coast guard to respond to militia activity.\n\nThere is little information about the full size of the maritime militia, but some estimate that it consists of more than 100 large vessels and as many as 3,000 smaller vessels. The lion's share of the maritime militia is concentrated in the South China Sea, where militia vessels often swarm by\n\nFinally, China's military forces also significantly overshadow Taiwan's. As of 2023, the PLA Navy comprises a battle force of over 370 vessels , many of which are based in areas close to the Taiwan Strait. The PLA Air Force and Navy also boast thousands of aircraft, which support China's ability to project power and conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) around Taiwan. If the situation around Taiwan goes kinetic, Taiwan would face a much larger force than its own, limiting its ability to effectively respond to aggressive Chinese activities.\n\n3 The MSA also likely possesses hundreds or thousands of other craft for operating in internal waterways, such as rivers. These would not be relevant for a contingency around Taiwan.\n\n|\n\nTable 1: The Balance of Naval and Air Power in the Taiwan Strait (2023)\n\n| Assets                                                            | China Total (near Taiwan Strait)*   | Taiwan Total                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Naval                                                             | Naval                               | Naval                              |\n| Aircraft Carriers                                                 | 2 (1)                               | 0                                  |\n| Amphibious Assault Ships                                          | 3 (3)                               | 0                                  |\n| Cruisers                                                          | 8 (4)                               | 0                                  |\n| Destroyers                                                        | 42 (30)                             | 4                                  |\n| Frigates                                                          | 47 (30)                             | 22                                 |\n| Corvettes                                                         | 50 (40)                             | 0                                  |\n| Medium Landing Ships/Tank Landing Ships/Amphibious Transport Dock | 57 (50)                             | 50                                 |\n| Attack Submarines                                                 | 47 (31)                             | 4                                  |\n| Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines                                 | 6 (2)                               | 0                                  |\n| Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarines                      | 6 (6)                               | 0                                  |\n| Coastal Patrol (Missile)                                          | 60 (60)                             | 43                                 |\n| Air (Air Force and Naval Aviation)                                | Air (Air Force and Naval Aviation)  | Air (Air Force and Naval Aviation) |\n| Fighters**                                                        | 1900 (750)                          | 300                                |\n| Bombers/Attack                                                    | 500 (300)                           | 0                                  |\n| Transport                                                         | 500 (40)                            | 50                                 |\n| Special Mission Aircraft                                          | 250 (150)                           | 20                                 |\n\n* Forces near the Taiwan Strait includes those within China's Eastern and Southern Theater Commands.\n\n** Excludes fighter trainers.\n\nSource: Department of Defense, Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2023 (Washington, DC: Department of Defense, 2023), https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-T HE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF.\n",

At its narrowest point, the Taiwan Strait is only about 130 km (81 miles) wide, meaning China does not have to deploy forces at long distances from China's own shores.\n\nChina. There are two less-busy ports-Hualien and Su'aoon Taiwan's east coast, as well as additional smaller harbors.\n\nAdding to Taiwan's exposure is the fact that the island has only a handful of major international ports. Most of the busiest ports-including Kaohsiung, Taichung, Taipei, Keelung, and Mailiao-are also the closest to mainland\n\nThe Port of Kaohsiung stands out among these. In 2022, an estimated 57 percent of Taiwan's maritime trade entered through the Port of Kaohsiung, making it an indispensable commercial hub for the island. 4  It is by far Taiwan's busiest port for containerized goods and oil, and the nearby Yung-An Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal is Taiwan's largest facility for importing LNG.\n\n4 Based on authors' calculations of data provided by IMF-PortWatch as of April 3, 2024. Percent values are based on trade value not volume.\n\n|\n\nFigure 3: Value of Imports into Taiwan's Major Ports (2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Authors' calculations based on data provided by IMFPortWatch, https://portwatch.imf.org/pages/data-and-methodology.\n\nAll  of  this  means it is easier for Chinese forces to reach Taiwan's most important shipping ports. In fact, if China can effectively control traffic into just one port, Kaohsiung, it can achieve significant influence over what gets into Taiwan.\n",

    "content": "## SCENARIO 2: FULL MARITIME QUARANTINE\n\nThis scenario is a significantly scaled-up version of the first scenario. Like the first scenario, China declares new\n\n'enhanced customs inspection rules' that will require advance notice with Chinese authorities to ship goods into Taiwan.\n\nThis time, however, China publicly announces a quarantine area covering the entire island of Taiwan. The zone extends 24 nautical miles from Taiwan's territorial baseline, matching with Taiwan's claimed contiguous zone. This is intended to delegitimize the contiguous zone and demonstrate China's willingness and capability to impose its will in an area ostensibly under Taipei's jurisdiction.\n\nChinese authorities announce that the inspection regime will go into effect 48 hours after declaration. China will require the shipper of any cargo destined for Taiwan to  file  advance notice with Chinese customs and law enforcement officials.\n\nChina again deploys law enforcement vessels to lead the quarantine, but this time it sends a much larger overall contingent. The greatest concentration, consisting of more than 10 coast guard and maritime safety vessels, is positioned off the coast of Kaohsiung. It also deploys a dozen vessels off the west coast ports of Taipei and Taichung and sends nine near the northern Port of Keelung-Taiwan's second-busiest import hub. Finally, it sends another six to the smaller eastern ports of Hualien and Su'ao.\n\nThis deployment of more than three dozen law enforcement vessels amounts to an unprecedentedly large maritime operation for China. It would constitute approximately one-fourth of China's oceangoing CCG and MSA fleet.\n\nRoughly 40 maritime militia vessels also swarm Taiwan's coastal waters, along the contiguous zone, to fill in gaps between law enforcement vessels.

They focus primarily on conducting ISR for China and complicating Taiwan's maritime domain awareness.\n\nAs in the limited quarantine scenario, China's navy deploys five SAGs to extend China's ISR, intimidate Taiwan, and deter U.S. and other forces that may try to intervene. PLA aircraft also fly regular sorties to conduct ISR around Taiwan. This time, China supplements its naval deployment by positioning the Shandong aircraft carrier and its strike group southeast of Taiwan. It launches frequent sorties of J-15 fighters east of Taiwan, repeating operations that the PLA exercised in recent years.\n\nIn this scenario, China is much more active in terms of boarding and searching vessels. Chinese forces stop at least one or two vessels per day for the period of the quarantine, focusing mostly on Taiwan-flagged ships. There also appear to be inspections of vessels belonging to some of the dozen countries that still maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.\n\nChinese forces seize several noncompliant ships and impound them at nearby ports within China. Commercial vessels that have filed the appropriate paperwork and had their requests approved are allowed into Taiwan. How- ever, due to heightened uncertainty about the nature of China's enforcement, many shipping companies choose to delay their shipments, causing a significant and noticeable decline of merchandise trade into Taiwan.\n\nAs the operation stretches into multiple days, Chinese ships and personnel need to be rotated. After the large initial deployment, China can fluctuate the number of forces depending on factors like capacity, the level of compliance with the quarantine, Beijing's desired intensity, and U.S. military posturing, if any.\n\nThese operations continue at varying levels for over two weeks before beginning to wind down. However, a significant CCG and PLA presence continues to operate indefinitely around Taiwan at a greater level than before the quarantine.\n",

    "content": "## CONCLUSION\n\nFor both these maritime scenarios, Beijing's goal is not to hermetically seal off Taiwan. Instead, these campaigns are designed to punish Taiwan, assert Beijing's claimed sovereignty over the island, test the response from international shipping companies, and put significant pressure on Taiwan.\n\n|\n\nWhile China has the capabilities to successfully execute these and other quarantine variations, these would require operations that are far more complex than anything China has demonstrated to date. Such moves would carry significant risk for China, and its success would depend to a large degree on how Taiwan, the United States, and others respond.\n\nEven if successfully implemented, there are limits to what a quarantine can achieve. If Beijing's goal is to inflict enough pain to force Taiwan's surrender, China would need to move beyond the gray zone into overt military action. A military blockade would be a key option for China if it seeks to forcefully unify Taiwan without launching an all-out invasion.\n\nStay tuned for part two of this series, which will explore how China could blockade Taiwan. /squareblack\n\nBonny Lin is a senior fellow for Asian security and director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.
